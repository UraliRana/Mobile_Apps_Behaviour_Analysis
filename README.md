# Mobile_Apps_Behaviour_Analysis
Description: The dataset contians the 50000 records with 12 features of Mobile App data. Here in this dataset our dependent variable is 'Enrolled' which plays important factor in this project. Based on the this features i can analyze the number of user who enrolled in the mobile app with respect to factors like age, numscreen, minigame, premium feature.e project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), feature engineering.

Skills: Data cleaning, Data preprocessing, Data insights, Data visualization, Feature Engineering, Model Building, Feature Scaling.

Models: Logistic Regression

Performance Measure: Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Result: Based on the insights it states the specfics groups of user who used the mobile app like younger age customers likley to be enrolled, customer who use to play minigames are more likley to enrolled, which customer going to be enrolled in the last hours of the day as well as for the last day of the week. It also gives information about customer like the app or not based it gives customer are more or less likely to be enrolled. So both the positive and negative about the features in which several reccommendtaion is given based on the negative features.
